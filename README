The source code for the Simple Linked List is in the following file:
	SimpleLinkedList.hh

The test suite can be found in this file:
	SimpleLinkedList_test.cc

I opted not to use something like Google Test, to avoid 3rd-party dependencies.
Instead, I created a quite simple testing framework (TestUtils.hh), that compiles
easily without any external dependencies.

As per the requirements, the implementation is a Simple Single Linked List. It
has just enough functionality to insert, remove, and iterate the list. The two
functions requested are named as follows:
	SimpleLinkedList::reverseIterative()
	SimpleLinkedList::reverseRecursive()

The following versions were used to develop and compile the code:

	$ make --version
	GNU Make 3.81
	Copyright (C) 2006  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.
	There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
	PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

	This program built for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

	$ g++ --version
	g++ (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 4.8.2
	Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

	$ uname -a
	Linux mcl-xubuntu1404lts-vm 3.13.0-35-generic #62-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 15 01:58:42 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I developed and compiled on a Xubuntu 14.04 LTS distribution.
(Xubuntu is a lighter weight distro of Ubuntu)

To compile:
	$ make

To clean:
	$ make clean

This is the simple output I get when compiling:
	$ make
	g++ -O2 SimpleLinkedList_test.cc -o SimpleLinkedList_test

The following is how the test suite is executed, with the output I get:
	$ ./SimpleLinkedList_test 
	Test Passed: TEST_size_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_size_notEmpty
	Test Passed: TEST_empty_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_empty_notEmpty
	Test Passed: TEST_insert_emptyHead
	Test Passed: TEST_append_emptyTail
	Test Passed: TEST_pop_front_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_pop_front_notEmpty
	Test Passed: TEST_pop_back_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_pop_front_notEmpty
	Test Passed: TEST_reset
	Test Passed: TEST_front_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_front_notEmpty
	Test Passed: TEST_back_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_back_notEmpty
	Test Passed: TEST_begin_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_begin_emptyConst
	Test Passed: TEST_beginEnd_notEmpty
	Test Passed: TEST_beginEnd_notEmptyConst
	Test Passed: TEST_end_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_end_emptyConst
	Test Passed: TEST_reverse_iterative_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_reverse_iterative_NotEmpty
	Test Passed: TEST_reverse_recursive_empty
	Test Passed: TEST_reverse_recursive_NotEmpty

Doxygen:
I didnt include the doxygen output, since archive files cant be sent,
but the following commands should generate the doxygen output:
	$ doxygen -g SimpleLinkedList

	Configuration file `SimpleLinkedList' created.

	Now edit the configuration file and enter

  	doxygen SimpleLinkedList

	to generate the documentation for your project

	$ doxygen SimpleLinkedList
